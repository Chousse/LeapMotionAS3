	 * The Bone class represents a tracked bone.

	 * <p>All fingers contain 4 bones that make up the anatomy of the finger.
	 * Get valid Bone objects from a Finger object.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Bones are ordered from base to tip, indexed from 0 to 3. Additionally,
	 * the boneâ€™s Type enum may be used to index a specific bone anatomically.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The thumb does not have a base metacarpal bone and therefore contains
	 * a valid, zero length bone at that location.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Note that Bone objects can be invalid, which means that they do not
	 * contain valid tracking data and do not correspond to a physical bone.
	 * Invalid Bone objects can be the result of asking for a Bone object
	 * from an invalid finger, indexing a bone out of range, or constructing
	 * a new bone. Test for validity with the Bone::isValid() function.</p>
