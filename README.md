[LeapMotionAS3](http://github.com/logotype/LeapMotionAS3)
=================

This is the AS3 framework for working with the Leap.

Created and maintained by [Victor Norgren](http://logotype.se)

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/logotype/LeapMotionAS3.git`.

Create an instance of the LeapMotion class (called Controller in the official docs)
	leap = new LeapMotion();
	leap.data.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_INIT, onInit );
	leap.data.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_CONNECTED, onConnect );
	leap.data.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_DISCONNECTED, onDisconnect );
	leap.data.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_EXIT, onExit );
	leap.data.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_FRAME, onFrame );

What you'll get from the LEAPMOTION_FRAME handler is a Frame object, with strongly
typed properties such as Hand, Pointables, Direction and much more.

Features

+ Very similar structure as the official API
+ No dependencies, creates a optimized socket directly to the Leap
