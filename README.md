This is the AS3 framework for working with the Leap.

Created and maintained by [Victor Norgren](http://logotype.se)

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/logotype/LeapMotionAS3.git`.

Create an instance of the LeapMotion class:

    leap = new LeapMotion();
    leap.controller.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_INIT, onInit );
    leap.controller.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_CONNECTED, onConnect );
    leap.controller.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_DISCONNECTED, onDisconnect );
    leap.controller.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_EXIT, onExit );
    leap.controller.addEventListener( LeapMotionEvent.LEAPMOTION_FRAME, onFrame );

What you'll get from the LEAPMOTION_FRAME handler is a Frame object, with strongly
typed properties such as Hands, Pointables, Direction and much more (this Frame object has all
the properties as per the official docs):

    public function onFrame( event:LeapMotionEvent ):void
    {
    	// Get the most recent frame and report some basic information
    	var frame:Frame = event.frame;
    	trace("Frame id: " + frame.id + ", timestamp: " + frame.timestamp + ", hands: " + frame.hands.length + ", fingers: " + frame.fingers.length + ", tools: " + frame.tools.length);
    
    	if ( frame.hands.length > 0 )
    	{
    		// Get the first hand
    		var hand:Hand = frame.hands[ 0 ];
    
    		// Check if the hand has any fingers
    		var fingers:Vector.<Pointable> = hand.fingers;
    		if ( fingers.length > 0 )
    		{
    			// Calculate the hand's average finger tip position
    			var avgPos:Vector3 = new Vector3( 0, 0, 0 );
    			for each ( var finger:Finger in fingers )
    				avgPos = avgPos.plus( finger.tipPosition );
    
    			avgPos = avgPos.divide( fingers.length );
    			trace("Hand has " + fingers.length.toFixed( 2 ) + " fingers, average finger tip position: " + avgPos);
    		}
    
    		// Get the hand's sphere radius and palm position
    		trace("Hand sphere radius: " + hand.sphereRadius.toFixed( 2 ) + " mm, palm position: " + hand.palmPosition);
    
    		// Get the hand's normal vector and direction
    		var normal:Vector3 = hand.palmNormal;
    		var direction:Vector3 = hand.direction;
    
    		// Calculate the hand's pitch, roll, and yaw angles
    		trace("Hand pitch: " + LeapMath.toDegrees( direction.pitch()).toFixed( 2 ) + " degrees, " + "roll: " + LeapMath.toDegrees( normal.roll()).toFixed( 2 ) + " degrees, " + "yaw: " + LeapMath.toDegrees( direction.yaw()).toFixed( 2 ) + " degrees");
    	}
    }

Features
--------

+ Very similar structure as the official API
+ Clean, lightweight and documented code
+ No external dependencies, creates a optimized socket directly to the Leap
+ Uses ASC 2.0 compiler features (be sure to add the "-inline" compiler argument)
+ Connect multiple computers to the same Leap device
+ Compatible with Mac and PC

Upcoming features
-----------------

+ Multi-threading using Workers
+ Optional dispatch model using Signals
+ AIR Native Extension (ANE) which directly interfaces with the C++ library
+ Example code will be added
